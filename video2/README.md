# Generator expressions

In the previous video we saw how to use list comprehensions instead of for loops to create a list but for our goal (print out words greater than 13 characters) it actually is more efficient to use a generator expression.

Look at the code in [list_comp](../video1/list_comp.py) and [gen_exp](gen_exp.py) to see the difference.
